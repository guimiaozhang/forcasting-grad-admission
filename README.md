# forcasting-grad-admission

## Purpose of this project

It was a machine learning course project. I am not very experienced to machine learning at that moment. Thus, I picked up a reletively simple project from Kaggle webset and tired my best to show my skills at that stage.

## Dataset

This link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions) provides the full description as well as the dataset.

'Admission_Predict_Ver1.1.csv' was used in this project.


## Coding environment

The code was originally fulfilled with google colab. To be comparable with '.py', some import may be adjusted.
